    The _AspNetCoreAllSharedFxIsEnabled property is meant for internal use only. When set to 'false',
    the default value of MicrosoftNETPlatformLibrary will be Microsoft.NETCore.App. It was added to support
    a better SDK exprience on platforms where the ASP.NET Core shared framework is not avaiable.
    In these cases, ASP.NET Core can still be as if it were just a set of NuGet packages.
